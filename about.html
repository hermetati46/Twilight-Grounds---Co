            <h3>From a Simple Idea to a Community Hub</h3>
            <!-- The <p> tag is used for paragraphs of text. -->
            <p>Twilight Grounds & Co. was founded in 2024 not just out of a love for coffee, but from a desire to build something meaningful. Our founder, working late nights as a student, always searched for a welcoming space that felt like a second homeâ€”a place to focus, relax, and connect. That perfect spot was hard to find, so the idea for Twilight Grounds was born: a neighborhood coffee shop that puts community and quality first.</p>
            <p>We started with a simple mission: to enrich our community by providing a unique coffee experience, fostering connections, and supporting sustainable and ethical practices from bean to cup. Every detail, from our cozy armchairs to our locally sourced art, is chosen to create a warm, inclusive atmosphere.</p>

                <li><strong>Community:</strong> We strive to be more than just a place that sells coffee. We are a hub for students, remote workers, friends, and families to gather and connect. We proudly feature the work of local artists and host community events.</li>
                <li><strong>Sustainability:</strong> We are committed to ethical practices. This includes fair trade partnerships with our coffee growers, using biodegradable packaging, and minimizing our environmental footprint wherever possible.</li>
